This is the repository for the Three Sugars WordPress theme.

I'm using Grunt to automate CSS & JS compilation, livereload when making changes and Bower to manage libraries such as Bootstrap, Modernizr etc.

### Automation & Livereload

Ensure you have Terminal or equivalent open and navigate to the Three Sugars theme directory. Then run `grunt`

This will start watching for any changes in your CSS, JS and PHP files and will livereload as soon as it detects a change
